<b>Minecraft</b> is a video game in which players create and break apart various kinds of blocks in three-dimensional worlds.
The gameâ€™s two main modes are Survival and Creative. 
In Survival, players must find their own building supplies and food. 
They also interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures. 
(Creepers and zombies are some of the dangerous ones.) 
In Creative, players are given supplies and do not have to eat to survive. 
They also can break all kinds of blocks immediately.
